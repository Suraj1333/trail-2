  sure you read the further stuff so I can get an idea if the things are really

Ok, so the thing is if anyone can see this article, then the backend worked. So this was a very long process to make the backend work and it is fun. Maybe the most interesting and satisfying part at least for me is I didn't have to write a single line of code to make this happen (to write and post this article ) and I'm really happy to look at what it actually turned out to be.
